# A Scala implementation of [the Android UI samples]()

To make it work you need to ...

* install git and sbt (using macports or brew)
* clone the repo
* start an emulator
* cd into the sub-directory of your choice
* run `sbt android:run` (might take a while the first time around)

... and you should be in business.
